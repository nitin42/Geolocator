# Geolocator
Script I wrote which tells the geographic coordinates of any street address or any other place using geopy in Django.

To install the script on your system, you would have to install the requirements into a virtual environment.
After installing the specified requirements, run the script as a normal python script on your terminal.

For eg: ``` $ python file_name.py```

The script uses **Terminal** module which come with **blessed** package. [Here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blessed/1.8.5) is the link to install the blessed package on your system explicitly.
